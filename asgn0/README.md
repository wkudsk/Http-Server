# Assignment 0 - Dog

Work done by William Kudsk (wkudsk) for CSE 130, Fall 2019

Dog is a program written in C++ that functions just the same as the cat linux command.
 - first use the Makefile to create an executable.
 - execute the program passing it either files or a dash.
 - The files must be something that can be printed, meaning that directories are not allowed.
